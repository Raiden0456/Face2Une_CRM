# FaceStellar CRM System

FaceStellar CRM is a Customer Relationship Management system designed for the FaceStellar beauty salon. The system is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://face2une-crm-prod.herokuapp.com/).

## Tech Stack

The project is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend.

### Backend

The backend of the application is built using:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is used for building fast and scalable network applications.
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- PostgreSQL with Supabase: Supabase adds realtime and RESTful APIs to Postgres and simplifies queries, providing a powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

### Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.
- JavaScript: The project is initialized with npm and runs on port 8000.

## Key Features

- **Certificate Changes**: The system supports changes to certificates, allowing for flexible management of customer certificates.
- **Coupon and Certificate Checks**: The system can check the status of coupons and certificates, ensuring accurate tracking of these customer benefits.
- **Calendar Integration**: The system integrates a calendar for scheduling and tracking appointments.

Please note that the project is still under development, and more features may be added in the future.
